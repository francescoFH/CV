I am an energetic and determined Full Stack Junior Developer, looking to be part of a team where I can continue to develop my programming skills, and I am excited to learn and work with new languages.

My background in one of the busiest industries, hospitality management/sales, gives me the confidence to perform well under pressure, and to work as part of a team to achieve crucial goals and deadlines. I will definitely bring these skills to my next role.

After recently graduated from an intensive 16 weeks bootcamp at [Makers](https://makers.tech/), one of the most reputable dev bootcamps in the world, I feel that I have come a long way from an amateur coder to become the confident and enthusiastic Junior developer that I am today.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Quick learner and Flexible** - Always worked in a multicultural environment, for me working with different challenges, with different teams, with multiple cultures makes work more interesting. I can easily learn new languages and adapt to new practices, as in my final project at Makers, that I had only two weeks to master Swift on Xcode and build a project from scratch.
- **Creative** - My background in Surveying and then in hospitality made me appreciate the power of creativity. I like to bring new and bold ideas to all my projects, while keeping focus on the team objectives. I have a problem-solving attitude that was useful every time a problem seemed unsolvable while working in my projects at Makers.
- **Interested and curious minded** - I love learning, and my journey in Makers was so gratifying because I had the opportunity to learn new languages, new ways of writing clean code, and I am looking forward to continuing to develop my skills.
- **Enthusiastic and dedicated** - When working on a new project I am always committed to enhance its potential, and to look at a problem as a new opportunity to learn.
One of the things that fascinates me in coding is the more I learn it, the more I want to keep learning, there is always a new way to approach a problem, and find that one tiny bug. I am always up for a new challenge.
- **Team-player** - I have managed teams with 30+ people in my previous roles, and I consider productive teamwork essential to accomplish great things. Although I am capable to work independently, and motivate myself to reach my goals, I find that working with a team can boost any project. I am comfortable to assume the lead or to follow indications, as needed.

### <a name="education">Education</a>

#### Makers Academy (October 2020 to January 2021)

- A 16 week intensive programming bootcamp.
- The training is primarily self-led, encouraging students to develop solutions to problems by themselves, in pairs, and in teams.
- Makers champions Agile/XP methodologies and practices, such as pair programming, TDD and OOD.
- Tech/Tools worked with: Ruby, Javascript, Swift, Rails, Sinatra, Xcode, PostgreSQL, TravisCI, Heroku, RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine.
- I have become familiar with remote working, as the course pivoted to remote work during the COVID-19 lockdown.
- Final project: [SOS-App][1] an emergency app that could save you when you're traveling the world!
