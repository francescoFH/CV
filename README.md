## Francesco Facca

I am an energetic and determined Full Stack Junior Developer, looking to be part of a team where I can continue to develop my programming skills, and I am excited to learn and work with new languages.

My background in one of the busiest industries, hospitality management/sales, gives me the confidence to perform well under pressure, and to work as part of a team to achieve crucial goals and deadlines. I will definitely bring these skills to my next role.

After recently graduated from an intensive 16 weeks bootcamp at Makers, one of the most reputable dev bootcamps in the world, I feel that I have come a long way from an amateur coder to become the confident and enthusiastic Junior developer that I am today.
