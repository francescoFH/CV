I am an energetic and determined Full Stack junior Developer, looking to be part of a team where I can continue to develop my programming skills. I am excited to learn and work with new languages.

My background in one of the busiest industries, hospitality management/sales, gives me the confidence to perform well under pressure, and to work as part of a team to achieve crucial goals and deadlines. I will definitely bring these skills to my next role.

After recently graduating from an intensive 16 weeks Bootcamp at [Makers](https://makers.tech/), one of the most reputable dev Bootcamps in the world, I feel that I have come a long way from an amateur coder to become the bold and enthusiastic junior developer that I am today.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Quick learner and Flexible** -   Experience in working efficiently in challenging and multicultural environments. I learn new languages easily and adapt to new practices, as in my final project at Makers, where I had only two weeks to master Swift on Xcode and build a project from scratch.
- **Interested and curious-minded** - I love learning, and my journey in Makers was so gratifying because I had the opportunity to learn new languages, new ways of writing clean code, and I am looking forward to continuing to develop my skills.
- **Enthusiastic and dedicated** - When working on a new project I am always committed to enhance its potential, and to look at a problem as a new opportunity to learn.
One of the things that fascinates me in coding is the more I learn it, the more I want to keep learning, there is always a new way to approach a problem, and find that one tiny bug. I am always up for a new challenge.

### <a name="education">Education</a>

#### Makers Academy (October 2020 to January 2021)

- A 16-week intensive programming bootcamp.
- The training is primarily self-led, encouraging students to develop solutions to problems by themselves, in pairs, and in teams.
- Makers champion Agile/XP methodologies and practices, such as pair programming, TDD and OOD.
- Tech/Tools worked with: Ruby, Javascript, Swift, Rails, Sinatra, Xcode, PostgreSQL, TravisCI, Heroku, RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine.
- I have become familiar with remote working, as the course pivoted to remote work during the COVID-19 lockdown.
- Final project: [SOS-App][1] an emergency app that could save you when you're traveling the world!

#### I.T.S. S. Pertini (Sept 2012 to Jul 2015) Diploma in Surveying
- My training in Surveying made me a creative person, it shaped me into an individual that brings new and bold ideas to all projects. It brought me a problem-solving attitude that is useful every time a problem seems unsolvable.
- Had my first contact with tech, as I spent a great amount of time doing projects using Autocad, and that made me want to start to learn how to use other programs in my free time.

### Experience

**SUSHISAMBA London** (September 2016 to September 2020)  
_Bar Manager_
- Managed teams with 30+ people, it taught me to work well alongside multicultural teams, and that productive teamwork is essential to accomplish great things.
- Had a wide range of responsibilities and with that I learnt to work well independently, and focus to reach my goals. It made me comfortable to assume the lead or to follow indications, as required, in any project.

**York & Albany - Gordon Ramsay Restaurants** (September 2015 to September 2016)  
_Head Bartender_
- Had the opportunity to work front and back house, be that direct contact with customers and sales, but also started taking management responsibilities.

### <a name="hobbies">Hobbies</a>

- Sports - Always practiced team sports, as football and volleyball. Both have great transferable skills, such as team work spirit, and the ability to focus on a common goal. Due to lockdown, I started practising Crossfit at home, as a way to keep my body and mind healthy, and it's also a great way to unwind after a day solving problems.
- Codewars - I really enjoy keeping my mind sharp, playing/practicing with codewars allows me to keep challenging my problem-solving capacity, while having fun learning new ways of writing clean code.
